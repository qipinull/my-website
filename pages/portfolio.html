            <h2>Project 2</h2>
            This is my biggest project, its a small game in pygame based around getting new high scores.<br \>
            There are enimies falling from the top of the screen, falling at random speeds while the player <br \>has to
            dodge them and collect points. If the player hits an enemy they loose a point,
            There are <br \>multiple game modes, timed and infinite. Timed has a 60 second limit where the goal is
            to get <br \>a high score which is saved in a seperate document, the same is said for the infinite game <br \>mode
            where the timer keeps counting up indefinitly.
